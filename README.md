My experimental database.

> [*Puffin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin) are any of three
 small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula with a
 brightly coloured beak during the breeding season. These are pelagic
 seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in
 large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in
 crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the
 tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific
 Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic
 Ocean.
